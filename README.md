# Neighborhood Map Project - Global Brewery Search
Version 1.0 12/9/2016

This is an app that I built to meet the project requirements of Udacity's frontend nanodegree, neighborhood map project. Both the Google Maps, and Yelp Business Search APIs are utilized allowing the user to locate 15 local brewery locations in a city of their choosing. The default location is Atlanta, GA.

## To run the app

Download the files to your computer (maintaining the file structure) and open the index.html file in your browser.

Once the index.html file is up, the menu/sidebar is where the user can enter a new city to search for local breweries. Once a search is completed the user can also enter the name (or part of the name), of a specific brewery to further filter their search results.

## Frameworks & Libraries used

- KnockoutJS
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- jquery-jsonp
- oauth-signature

## Credit to sources!

A big thanks to the following sites/people who helped guide me through my learning process during this project...

- Udacity courses (Intro to AJAX, Javascript Design Patterns, Google Maps APIs)
- Udacity discussion forum for the project
- stackoverflow.com (with countless questions, as always!)
- Simple Bootstrap sidebar by Start Bootstrap [here](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/)
- Other student projects that I checked out along the way including [this one](https://github.com/justintemps/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map) and [this one](https://github.com/justinrboone/Brewery-Finder). Both were very helpful in getting me to think about different methods I could use to get this app functioning the way I wanted it to.
